# Svelte-DragDropList

Sortable lists [made with Svelte](https://madewithsvelte.com/svelte-dragdroplist).  [Available from NPM!](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-dragdroplist)  

### Credit
* This package is an extension of [svelte-dragdroplist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-dragdroplist) created by [jwlarocque](https://www.npmjs.com/~jwlarocque), who is original author.
* `svelte-dragdroplist-clickable` was created with features required for our own project.

### Why this component?

* Bidirectional binding - data order updates as soon as the user drags a list item into a new position, even before it is dropped
* Full touch support - doesn't use the HTML5 drag and drop API
* Accessible - includes buttons to move elements without dragging
* Double clicking on element returns its contents
* Easier than writing a new one, probably.

### Usage

[Basic REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/6fb61b9868734493aec65eb53dc1a4bd?version=3.22.2)  
[REPL with every feature!](https://svelte.dev/repl/915db3b3ed704fddb7ddfb64bcbc2624?version=3.22.2)  

The simplest way to use the component is to pass it an array of unique strings.  If you `bind:data`, the source array will be updated as the user rearranges its items.
```js
<script>
    import DragDropList from "svelte-dragdroplist";

    let data = ["Adams", "Boston", "Chicago", "Denver"];
</script>

<DragDropList bind:data={data}/>
```

##### Unique IDs

If you aren't sure that your strings will be unique, you should instead pass an array of objects, each with a unique ID:  

```js
let data = [{"id": 0, "text": "Boston"}, 
            {"id": 1, "text": "Boston"}, 
            {"id": 2, "text": "Chicago"}, 
            {"id": 3, "text": "Denver"}];
```

##### HTML

You can also include an "html" attribute instead of "text".  It's up to you to make sure the html is clean.  
  If you want, you can even use both in one list.  
```js
let data = [{"id": 0, "text": "Adams"}, 
            {"id": 1, "text": "Boston"}, 
            {"id": 2, "html": "<p style='color: blue;'>Chicago</p>"}, 
            {"id": 3, "html": "<p style='color: red;'>Denver</p>"}];
```

##### Removable Items

A delete button can be added to each item with the `removesItems` prop:
```js
<DragDropList bind:data={data} removesItems={true}/>
```
Note: _adding_ items is as simple as adding them to the data array.

##### Getting Item Data on Double Click

Double clicking items will return the value of the item with `itemDblClick` event:
```js
<DragDropList bind:data={data} itemDblClick={(e) => { console.log(e)}}/>
```

### Styling

To style the list and its elements from a parent component or global stylesheet, prefix your selectors with `.dragdroplist`.  You may need to increase the specificity of your selectors or even use the `!important` rule in order to override the classes applied by Svelte.  For example:

```css
:global(.dragdroplist) {} /* entire component */
:global(.dragdroplist > .list > div.item) {} /* list item */
:global(.dragdroplist > .list > div.item.item-active) {} /* list item active */
:global(.dragdroplist > .list > div.item.item-active svg) {} /* styling the svg icons when an item is in active state */
:global(.dragdroplist div.buttons > button.down) {} /* move down button */
:global(.dragdroplist div.content) {} /* text/html contents of item */
```

If you only need to style the contents of an item, you can also use an object with an `html` property as described above.

### In Progress

* Additional animations on drop  
* Option for Additional buttons along with removeItems button
